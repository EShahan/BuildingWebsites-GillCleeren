                        Bethany received the recipe for this delicious apple pie from her grandmother. At the age of
                        5,
                        she
                        was
                        already baking this <em>all-American traditional apple</em> pie at her home.

                    <h2>How we make this pie</h2>
                    <ol type="A">
                        <li>
                            First, we combine sugar, flour and spices. We toss the apples with some lemon juice and
                            add
                            sugar.
                        </li>
                        <li>We then create the bottom crust and fill that with apple mixture. We put some butter on
                            that. We
                            then roll remaining crust to fit top of pie.
                        </li>
                        <li>Then we beat the eggs white until we have a foamy mix. That is then brushed over the
                            crust.
                            We
                            sprinkle some extra sugar.
                        </li>
                        <li>Then the pie goes into the oven at 360Â° for 35 minutes. When ready, we let it cool on a
                            wire
                            rack.
                        </li>
                    </ol>

                    <ol start="5">
                        <li>If something goes wrong, we start all over again!</li>
                    </ol>
