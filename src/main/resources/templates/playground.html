<div class="intro-text">Welcome to <b>Bethany's Pie Shop</b>, where pie-baking perfection meets convenience!
    <h3>Our history</h3>
    For countless years, Bethany's passion for crafting the most scrumptious pies has been an unmatched delight. Our
    journey began in 2013 when we
    unveiled our first charming store in the heart of Brussels (Belgium), nestled in a cozy little street near the
    illustrious Grand Market.

            It was here that our pies first captured the hearts and taste buds of people from every corner of the
            globe, from delectable soft cakes to heavenly cheesecakes and tantalizingly spiced apple
            pies. <i>Our store's extraordinary success was nothing short of a culinary fairy tale.</i>
            As the demand for Bethany's divine creations soared, an incredible milestone was reached in 2015, when
            we
            proudly sold an astonishing 100 pies each day! Naturally, our beloved Pie Shop had to evolve, and we
            relocated
            to a grander, more spacious building to better serve our cherished patrons. The love and support we
            received
            from our ever-growing community inspired us to explore new possibilities.
